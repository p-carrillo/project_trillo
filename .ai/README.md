# AI Documentation Guide

## What `.ai/` is
The `.ai/` directory contains the authoritative internal guidance used by humans and agents to design, implement, and review this monorepo.

## What standards are
The `.ai/standars/` files define mandatory engineering standards for architecture, coding, testing, API design, operations, Docker, and delivery.

## Mandatory status
All standards in `.ai/standars/` are mandatory. Any exception must be explicitly documented and approved through an ADR.

## Agent authority
`/AGENTS.md` is the authoritative source for agent behavior, role responsibilities, and change workflow.

## ADR policy
Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in `.adr/` track relevant decisions and their rationale. ADRs must be created or updated for significant architectural, runtime, dependency, and process changes.
