# Severity Guide

Use this guide to map findings to priorities.

- `P0`: blocking issue that is universally harmful or release-blocking.
- `P1`: urgent issue likely to cause major malfunction or strong regression.
- `P2`: meaningful correctness, reliability, or maintainability issue.
- `P3`: low-priority issue or improvement opportunity.

Set priority based on observed impact in the changed code, not hypothetical edge cases.
